# AlcardianTimer
A clock program written in java. It have clock, accumulator, countcown and timer modes.
This project was originaly written somewhere around 2010-2011 as a Java assignment in a programing course that was much smaller in scope. After the course ended I continued to update it and add new functionality.

The source code that is in use is found under the "alcardianTimer" sub-folder of src, the "org.alcardian.timer" sub-folders are work in progress for a new version of the program with new functionality along with the code being restructured.
